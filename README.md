# FordBikeSystemData-Communicating-data-findings
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area
There are 183412 data in the set before cleaning, 174377 after cleaning. The datasets has 16 initial columns before cleaning, and 23 columns after cleaning. I added extra columns (member_age, start_day, end_day, start_month, end_month, duration_min, distance_km) to gain more insights from the data

In the first section, I performed an exploratory data analysis on the dataset called Ford GoBike System Data in the first section. I explored the dataset's features using Python and data visualization libraries to understand the data's structure, peculiarities, trends, and relationships. This section's study is arranged, moving from univariate relationships to bivariate relationships to complex multivariate relationships.

> I used an explanatory analysis in the second section to share the key findings I made during my research. In order to accomplish this, I produced a slide deck that uses clean, explanatory visualizations to present my findings.


## Dataset
> This data set includes information on each ride taken in a bike-sharing program that serves the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The data sets includes the following initial columns
>
Start Time and Date
End Time and Date
Start Station ID
Start Station Name
Start Station Latitude
Start Station Longitude
End Station ID
End Station Name
End Station Latitude
End Station Longitude
Bike ID
User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)

> During the data wrangling process, I accessed the data to gain insights and understand the data,I cleaned the data and make necessary changes, I also add new columns such as duration time, distance travelled in km, days the bike were used by both subcribers and customers. 


## Summary of Findings
> There were more trips on work days (Mon-Fri) than on weekends. The number of journeys peaked between 8 and 9 am and 4 to 6 pm during the weekday. Subscribers' usage is significantly higher than total constumer usage. Customers' and subscribers' riding habits are very different from one another. Customers typically ride in the afternoon or early evening on weekends, whilst subscribers utilize the bike sharing system mostly for trips on workdays (Mon-Fri). Peak subscriber usage occurs throughout the morning and late afternoon. Another major findings was that most of the bike users are male, but the females tends to ride more than the other genders in the dataset


## Key Insights for Presentation
> Most of the bike users fall between the ages of 20- 40 years, Most of the users of the bike systems are mostly male, conversely, the females tend to ride for more minutes than the other genders in the dataset. In addition, subscribers use the system heavily on work days (Monday -Friday) whereas customers ride more on weekends, and frequently in the afternoon. Many trips concentrated around 8-9 am and 4-6 pm on work days for subscribers, yet customers tend to use more in the late afternoon around 5 pm Monday to Friday. The efficient/short period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their high concentration on rush hours Monday through Friday, indicating the use is primarily for the work commute.
